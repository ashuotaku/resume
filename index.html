    <h2>My Coding Journey:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>I was always interested towards computers, but I don't had a computer till class 8th.</li>
        <li>During class 6th, I studied about QBASIC, so I tried to run it on my android phone usnig virtual machines and all that stuffs.</li>
        <li>During class 7th, I studied about Python in my computer book, so I started to study and run python through my android mobile phone. And, therefore I learnt some basics of python in my 7th class.</li>
        <li>I also learnt about HTML in my 7th class, therefore I also learnt about HTML through my mobile phone and made some basic HTML and CSS websites in my mobile phone.</li>
        <li>During class 8th, due to lockdown and online classes, I had so much time for coding and in that class I won scholarship (my father told that he would buy me a computer if I won scholarship, therefore I won that), therefore my first computer came during my 8th class.</li>
        <li>Therefore, in 8th class, I learnt so much about how computers work, how windows work and tried to experiment with these things and damaged my OS, therefore after getting it repaired, I study about the basic of OS and how to install it again if another BSOD comes.</li>
        <li>In 8th class during lockdown, I also made some useful websites for my school, I didn't knew about github backthen, therefore I have lost those works.</li>
        <li>I learnt all of my beginners coding skills through youtube and some free helpful websites.</li>
        <li>In 9th class, I improved my school both in web development and Python, therefore I created a basic social media website like quora with the help of HTML, CSS and JS as frontend and Python's Flask Module as backend. It was my first dynamic website and I learnt all these from youtube, so it was not that great, but backend was still nice. - <a href="https://github.com/ashu-otaku/quewer">Github Link</a></li>
        <li>In the last months on 9th class, due to parental and peer pressure, I had to quit coding and I started studying for my schools and 10th boards.</li>
        <li>In 10th I got 97% and decided to prepare for JEE because I wanted to go to the best college in India for Computer Science (IIT Bombay).</li>
        <li>In first few months of 11th, I prepared well for JEE but during the last months of 11th my interest again bent towards coding, and I wasted so much time in the confusion between coding and study. And 11th and 12th class was one of the darkest time of my life.</li>
        <li>In 11th and 12th class, I learnt so much about linux and my personal favorite linux is Arch Linux, and I am currrently using Arch Linux + Hyprland as my personal OS.</li>
        <li>During 12th class half, I decided to revise web development from scratch as I have forgot many concepts, therefore I bought a web development course from udemy of a developer named as Angela Yu.</li>
